Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.
Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.
Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.
Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.

"Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor","Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing
🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳
Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.
🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾
The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.
🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈
The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?
🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰
There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor","Bom custo benefício","O smartphone é bem leve, a tela tem um bom tamanho, ótima resolução, muito espaço interno, funções rápidas e a cor do aparelho é bem bonita. Bom custo benefício para o uso do dia a dia, redes sociais, navegação de internet, transações bancárias, fotos e vídeos (ótima resolução e diversas funções). Carregamento bem rápido e bateria dura bastante. Estou com o aparelho há uma semana e não apresentou problemas, mas como usuário médio não fui além para testar as capacidades do aparelho. Pontos negativos é o touch digital q fica atrás do aparelho, apesar de bem pensado para o uso (sem capa) achei um pouco pequeno e às vezes não reconhece, talvez para um dedo maior seja mais trabalhosa a precisão.
A entrega foi demorada (e atrasou em um dia), péssimo para os padrões do Prime (era quando fiz a compra), talvez porque veio pelo Correio, mas chegou sem problemas apesar da caixa do aparelho estar ""solta"" dentro da caixa do vendedor. Minha sugestão para o revendedor é talvez colocar uns krafts amassados ou outra coisa para minimizar o ""vai e vem"". De resto estou bem satisfeito com o aparelho.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"Panasonic Eluga i7 (2GB RAM, 16GB Storage, Finger Print Sensor, 4000mAh Battery) (Black)","Updated version of Android 9..Eluga I7 Enterprise Edition","Okk I am writing a review after using one day ..
I gifted this mobile to my mother and she liked a lot ..
First of all I let you know this is an updated version of Eluga I7..as you can check on the pictures posted by me ..it's Eluga I7 Enterprise Edition..
And this is updated to Android 9.0 pie..
Whereas the Normal Version is only Android 7 version( which is available on Flipkart).
This mobile does not have tray SIM slot..rather you can open the back cover and easily insert both the SIM and Memory card..and has Non Hybrid Sim Slots..But point to note here is SIM 1 is Micro and SIM 2 Nano ..
Camera quality is gud not so gorgeous with 8MP for both Front and Back ..with Flash Led lights on both sides..you can't expect more in this price range .
The best thing is it's Battery Back up of 4000 MAH..
Videos run smooth you tube and all.
You can increase the Storage space .. accordingly.
Doesn't support quick charging so it takes time for charging but the battery backup is worth .
My Verdict would be if you are getting so many features fr a price of 6499 ..it's worth buying ..
A thumbs up from me.👍👍👍","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"Nokia 105 Single SIM (Black)","Not the Nokia I knew.","My grandparents have had a great experience with Nokia handsets. Good battery life, durable, good sound quality. That's all my grandma needed and it served the purpose. Of course these were purchased offline and at a time when smartphones were not dirt cheap.
Guess now Nokia doesn't make em as they used to or inferior/faulty devices are being sold online.
The day she received it, the call volume was low at her end but it was okay. But at the other end there was static. We tried different sims, different locations but still the same. Day 3 the call volume went down drastically and she couldn't hear a thing. She could hear if she tried really hard and pressed the phone against her ear.
Totally disgusted by the product as it has been a nightmare for my grandparents during these tough times to get this phone working and no other means to contact.
Being a prime member I assured them that the phone could be replaced if there were any problems but for some reason pick up wasn't available and they had to send the device back. I couldn't ask them to do that. It's harrasment and sending it through courier is next to impossible for those old souls.

"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.","This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.
Good:
- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!
- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.
- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.
- 6000 Mah battery is BIG
- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.
- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE
- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.
- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.
- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.
- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good
- Received next day by 11 AM !
Not So Good:
- Not that thin, but ok.
- Doesn't have Samsung Dex
- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.
- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)
- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.
Feedback
- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.
- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.
Go for it without any doubt.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Cons:
1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.
2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.
3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.
Pros:
1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.
2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.
3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Serious Issue","The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.
Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.
However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.
So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.
Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Cons:
If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.
Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.
Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.
Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics game
Battery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate perform
For charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.
Macro camera - useless feature
Front and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.

1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.
2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.
3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.
4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest Note 9.
5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.
6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.
7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.

cons:
1.It feel like a cheap phone idk why,there are some phones in this price segment ""looks"" premium.
2.No LED notification,a major missing.
3.Rear Camera is not that good in default,but when we changed to 48MP it looks ""kinda"" good.It seems like good in this price segment.
4.Its little bit getting Hot while charging and I feel some Hottnes while taking photos(maybe coz of outside temperature)
5.It takes quite a bit to get fully charged,yah the battery is 6000 but its fast charging with 18W.
6.so much pre installed apps(we can uninstall it) and also like previously,we have to go through each app to disable ""Recommendations""
Pros:
1.Very light weight and it doesn't feel a massive 6000 is inside
2.Front camera is Superb! good detailed pics in portrait.
3.Battery is so good.I use the phone to take a lot of pictures and use it for 1 hr swiping through Instagram,the battery doesn't notice that at all lol(its pretty good)
4.Stereo speaker does that job GOOD
5.For games,ya with a medium settings it is good for 1hr continuous gaming after that it gets little hot but there is no overheating like that issue till now.

(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)
• A phone with Superb Design and unique colours
• I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks
• Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands
• Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality
!! BUT BUT BUT !!
• Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.
• The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.
(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)
• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup
• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge
(It takes time to Charge full)
• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phone
Summary:-
Purchase it if u want as a secondary phone
Purchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour options
Purchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)
Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.
This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.
So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.
The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.
The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.
I regret buying this in the flash sale.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.
My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.

Amazon delivered it very speedy on 23rd Dec 2020.
Reviews:
1) Camera: Average for both front and back cameras.
2) Sound: Good
3) Battery: Drained very fastly, even charging is a bit slower, not looks like 6000 mah.
4) Processor: slow processing and sometimes hang also. And touch is also responding slow.
5) Games: I didn't try much yet.

Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.
Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.
Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Electric Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","It is a powerbank with good camera, storage and average phone features.","My review after three months use:
I am reducing it to one stars after three months use. Initially I gave five star. Reasons of giving one star is:
1) the phone is over priced and it's actual price should be not more than 13-14K.
2) occassionally it's back panel heats up.
3) design is poor, especially at the back camera panel space above the flashlight is unutilized and don't look premium. Much cheaper mobile phones have better design.
3) the whole body including screen, back panel and camera panel is very sensitive to scratches. You have to cover with phone case and screen guard immediately otherwise your phone will give a dirty look full if scrates after one week use.
3) no IP rating. Forget water proofing, not a trace of water resistance. You have to prevent it from humidity and sweating.
4) screen refresh rate is poor in comparison to other phones available below 10K range.
Following was my review after almost one week use. __________________________________
At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.
However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.
Battery:
Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.
User Interface:
User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.
Dolby Sound:
Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.
External Outlook:
Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.
Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Electric Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Not recommend, if you want waste your money then purchase","Cons:_
Overpriced
Battery drain only fast in normal uses give only 24 hours backup.
Sound quality is so so
Build quality is not good
Pros:_
Good processor
Good camera
User interface is good
Finger print sensor working very fast but some times missed out.
After six days of uses, impressed with camera performance, Display, fingerprint working, and processor.
Disappointed with Battery performance my brother realme 2 giving easily 2days battery backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery backup only 24 hours with 7000. I have doubt its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating issue also faced during charging.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

Not Upto the Mark..
Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..
I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...
Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..
Lookwise not good
Display qaulity is just good not best
Sound quality is good
Camera not much good that I am expecting.
Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.

"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Electric Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","One of the best phones at affordable price...","Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:
1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.
2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.
3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.
4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.
5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.
6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.
7. No headphones in the box.
8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.
Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.
Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"Redmi Note 10 (Shadow Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Wait for Poco version of the same","Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gb
Redmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fast
If you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10
About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your card
In the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay again
Also while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offers
First of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual apps
I am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streaming
Pros:
Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)
Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag there
Mobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speed
Feel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is less
Camera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)
Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.
Cons:
Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an update
Plastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near camera
Stereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)
Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast charger
This covered almost all of them (not fully though)
Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back.","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"Redmi Note 10 (Shadow Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","Please Read this Review Carefully before you buy this.","Finally, Xiaomi has decided to design for its Note series of mobiles. This mobile phone is definitely going to be and head Turner when you pull the mobile out of the pocket. It has an almost 1mm protruding camera module on the rear of the mobile. I have bought aqua-green color which has these light gradient shade. The colors are up to your personal preferences.
The phone has a matte finish at the back so it is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. It also doesn't feel very heavy and is very easy to hold firmly.
🎯DESIGN and DISPLAY:
******************************
This 6.43-inch display with the Full HD Plus resolution is really good along with a punch-hole selfie camera that offers a seamless user experience.
The brightness can go up 1100 nits peak so it is definitely not a difficult thing to use it under sunlight. Xiaomi provided this model with the Widevine L1 DRM certification support for this mobile. So, playing HD videos on an ott platform won't be an issue.
Z-axis haptic motor used in this mobile throws more realistic vibrations while playing games. I tried it extensively with a couple of games, the experience was really satisfying. Kudos to Xiaomi for throwing in all the sensors on this mobile especially for not giving up on the remote control sensor.
This mobile comes with a lot of preloaded apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, MI remote, MI credit, MI Store, MI pay, share m, etc. Out of these, you can uninstall a couple of apps and you have to live with the remaining apps for the rest of the life.
🎯PERFORMANCE:
**********************
The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and highly responsive that even if you touch the sensor unintentionally you will end up unlocking the phone. It is that fast. Games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty worked excellently without any lag or freezing. This mobile would definitely outscore any mobile under this budget easily.
It took 25 to 35 minutes to charge the mobile from 0 to 75% using the 33 Watts charger which came along with the mobile.
🎯CAMERA:
**************
It comes with the 48-megapixel F/1.79 main camera with Sony Sensor and an 8mp ultrawide camera and the remaining two are the macro and the depth sensor.
The main camera will let you shoot 4K 30fps video and 960fps 720 p video. When provided with good lighting conditions the main camera gives you a decent output and the Portrait mode also did a good job by blurring out the background gently.
The low light images were average and it was decent enough for mobile phones with a budget of 15k.
Coming to the selfie camera The Portrait mode worked excellently and the pictures were on a little warm tone than a natural skin tone. If you don't like the warm tone on your selfie pictures then you can fix it through editing apps from Play Store.
🎯VERDICT:
**************
This mobile offers Rock-solid performance for everyday tasks along with very good battery life. This mobile phone comes with MIUI 12.5 so you don't have to worry about future updates for at least the next two years. With AMOLED display and the stereo speakers along with IP53 rating, this has to be the most competent mobile phone under 15000 and a good value for money.
I have a YouTube channel: Gizmofeatures (You can also find the unboxing and impressions video there). When Comparing with Poco M3, Moto G10 Power, Samsung M12, you can pick Redmi note 10 any day. It is the best among these Four.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

6)sound Quality was good at good signal strength.
cons :
1)lost Nokia originality Feel Little Bit From HMD Global.
2)some Times calls was auto disconnected behalf some network issue , but its OK if you restart it will fine
3)Flash light will turned off if you are tried to lock your Screen.
5) 6 Games were built in . may that occupies more space in 4 Mb of this mobile.might be the network problem was because of this.
6)Sound quality lost if signal was low.
7)Lock Screen Changed . not like old Nokia.
8)Software was s30+ ,it wasn't gives you a look like old Nokia Symbian OS.its completely new.
9)Nokia connecting people animation missed in this mobile.
Finally you can buy if you are Nokia Lover . its gives you a Nokia brand feel externally .all built quality and ringtone was looks like old Nokia...

"Nokia 105 Single SIM (Blue)","Not the Nokia I knew.","My grandparents have had a great experience with Nokia handsets. Good battery life, durable, good sound quality. That's all my grandma needed and it served the purpose. Of course these were purchased offline and at a time when smartphones were not dirt cheap.
Guess now Nokia doesn't make em as they used to or inferior/faulty devices are being sold online.
The day she received it, the call volume was low at her end but it was okay. But at the other end there was static. We tried different sims, different locations but still the same. Day 3 the call volume went down drastically and she couldn't hear a thing. She could hear if she tried really hard and pressed the phone against her ear.
Totally disgusted by the product as it has been a nightmare for my grandparents during these tough times to get this phone working and no other means to contact.
Being a prime member I assured them that the phone could be replaced if there were any problems but for some reason pick up wasn't available and they had to send the device back. I couldn't ask them to do that. It's harrasment and sending it through courier is next to impossible for those old souls.
Very very disappointed. Never expected this from Amazon. Cannot rely on the service when I really need them.","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"Redmi 9 (Carbon Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) | 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor","Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing
🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳
Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.
🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾
The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.
🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈
The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?
🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰
There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

Its a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.
The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.
Battery is ok.
The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.
Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.
Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.
I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.
12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.
Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.
The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.

"Redmi 9 (Carbon Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) | 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core Processor","Bom custo benefício","O smartphone é bem leve, a tela tem um bom tamanho, ótima resolução, muito espaço interno, funções rápidas e a cor do aparelho é bem bonita. Bom custo benefício para o uso do dia a dia, redes sociais, navegação de internet, transações bancárias, fotos e vídeos (ótima resolução e diversas funções). Carregamento bem rápido e bateria dura bastante. Estou com o aparelho há uma semana e não apresentou problemas, mas como usuário médio não fui além para testar as capacidades do aparelho. Pontos negativos é o touch digital q fica atrás do aparelho, apesar de bem pensado para o uso (sem capa) achei um pouco pequeno e às vezes não reconhece, talvez para um dedo maior seja mais trabalhosa a precisão.
A entrega foi demorada (e atrasou em um dia), péssimo para os padrões do Prime (era quando fiz a compra), talvez porque veio pelo Correio, mas chegou sem problemas apesar da caixa do aparelho estar ""solta"" dentro da caixa do vendedor. Minha sugestão para o revendedor é talvez colocar uns krafts amassados ou outra coisa para minimizar o ""vai e vem"". De resto estou bem satisfeito com o aparelho.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

First, the colour is unique which makes it stand out of the other phones in this segment. The rough contour at the back helps to solidify the grip. So seems to be quite suitable for rough users.
Secondly, the battery backup is pretty huge despite the screen and ability to multitask.
Apps run smoothly, and camera quality is excellent during day, and decent during the night. Network and storage is another USP, as my primary usage is to make calls.
The big screen and RAM let's you enjoy netflix, games, and youtube all the the same time, in super HD quality. And not to forget the face unlock feature!

It takes a little time for phone to get fully charged, but once it is, I can get a lot of work done. If you are looking for screen size and battery you can go for this.
